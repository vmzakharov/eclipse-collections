12.0.0
====================

This is the 12.0.0 major release.

This release focused on migrating the development baseline from Java 8 to Java 11, migrating to JUnit 5, enhancing performance, adding new API methods, improving test coverage, and updating dependencies. The team has also made significant efforts to reduce technical debt and improve code quality.

The Eclipse Collections team gives a huge thank you to everyone who participated in this release.
